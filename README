Installing
==========

* Install the haikuports package:

    python setup.py install

* Optionally, copy haikuports.conf to /boot/common/etc and adjust it to override
  the default paths


Usage
=====

After installation, run 'hpbuild -h' for usage information.

In contrast with haikuporter, hpbuild doesn't require a local copy of the
haikuports tree. You can still checkout the tree using the '-g' option. When
you're working on a port, you should pass the '-r' flag to hpbuild to tell it
to use the local build/test/install scripts and patch instead of fetching them
from the HaikuPorts website.

Look at sys-devel/distcc to see how the the scripts and patch should be named.
